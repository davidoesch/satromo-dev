# SATROMO Processing chain

The "Erdbeobachtungs-SAtellitendaten f√ºrs TRockenheitsMOnitoring" (SATROMO) consists of python code with ETL functionalities to operationally generate and provide AnalysisReadyData and indices from satellite sensors using GoogleEarthEngine, GithubAction and AWS S3 / Cloudfront 

## Disclaimer

**Note: This project is currently in the commissioning phase and is limited for operational use.**

## Introduction and Project Description

This project aims to define automated spatial satellite products, indices, and analysis-ready datasets (ARD), as well as establish a geospatial data processing pipeline with traceable algorithms in the field of drought monitoring.
The aim is to have a serverless processing chain to derive and publish satellite sensor derived products for drought monitoring. 

There are two environments:
- DEV which is a local machine with python installes
- PROD which is GitHub Action based.

## Installation

To install and set up the project, follow the instructions below:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/swisstopo/topo-satromo.git
```
2. Install the project dependencies using pip:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Make sure you have Python 3.x and pip installed on your system.

[Optional] If you are using a virtual environment, activate it:
```
source <virtual-environment>/bin/activate
```
This step is recommended to isolate the project dependencies from your system-wide Python installation.

4. By default, the configuration used is the file `configuration\dev_config.py`.
You can use another configuration file for your own setup. 
To choose another configuration, use a command-line argument to point towards 
the configuration file contained in the <configuration> folder.

For example, if you want the configuration file `configuration\myconfig.py` to be used for your processing,
you can define it using the following statement:

> python satromo_processor.py myconfig.py

Note that all configuration files have to be located in the configuration folder

5. You are now ready to use the project!

For the use on your local machine / DEV 
- You need to create a folder "secrets" containing
    - GoogleEarthEngine credentials: the GEE json `keyfile.json` according to your [Google Service Account](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/service_account) and a private key for the [service account](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/service_account#create-a-private-key-for-the-service-account). Ensure that service  account has the [Earth Engine API enabled](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/cloud/earthengine_cloud_project_setup) and has been has been [registered](https://code.earthengine.google.com/register) for use with Earth Engine. Then you also need to activate your  GoogleDrive / Google developers console API activation for your ServiceAccount Project https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/drive.googleapis.com/overview?project=<YourprojectID> to access GDRIVE via API
    - rclone set up: To move files from GoogleDrive to your TargetDestination we use [rclone](https://rclone.org/). Make sure that either rclone is installed,  and path to it is set .set up `rclone.conf` :
        ```
        [<GEEDRIVE_DEV as definend in the configuration file>]
        type = drive
        scope = drive
        service_account_file = keyfile.json
        team_drive = 
        
        [<S3_DEV as definend in configuration file>]
        type = s3
        provider = AWS
        access_key_id = <your key>
        secret_access_key = <your access key>
        region = <your region>
        location_constraint = <your region>
        ```
        
For the use with GithubAction / INT
Adapt your GoogleEarthEngine and rclone credentials
- GoogleEarthEngine credentials: create a secret for github action called "GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET" copy paste `keyfile.json` into it
- rclone credentials: create a secret for github action called "RCONF_SECRET" copy paste`rclone.conf` into it

## Solution architecture
### Program flows  (`satromo_processor.py` and `satromo_publisher.py`)

![Diagram](satromo_processor.drawio.svg)

## Functionality in detail

For starters, we build a GithubAction & GEE python based ARD and Indices extractor for Switzerland. The SATROMO operational module is started on a pre-defined schedule using [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).The "processor" run is using by default the [dev_config.py](configuration/dev_config.py]). A specific configuration can be started with `python satromo_processor.py my_config.py`.  During a "processor" run, the code:
1. Check the existence and completeness of personal collections in `step0`: post-processed Google Earth Engine (GEE) sensor collection with selected co-registered bands, topographic correction (TOA products), cloud & terrain shadow masks
2. triggers GEE extraction of products for the region of Switzerland using the personal collection using the configuration and last update information in `tools/last_updates.csv`
3. stores running tasks in `processing/running_tasks.csv` and an appropriate accompanying text file for each product which is split in quadrants to enable GEE exports
4. persists information about status of running GEE processes IDs of the extracted data. These pieces of information are stored directly in the repository at hand.  

A pre-defined time after the "processor" run, a "publisher" run starts, assuming all exports are done. In it, the publisher process:
1. reads the persisted information as to the most recently bprocessed  products based on IDs in `processing/running_tasks.csv`
2. merges and clips the products, e.g. ARD, indices etc. locally in GitHubAction runner. Be aware that the current limit is the disk space available on github (approximately 7 GB)
3. moves the product and its persisted information with rclone to S3
4. creates a static STAC Catalog
5. updates `tools/last_updates.csv`.
6. invalidates the STAC Catalog on Coudfront: [STAC BROWSER](https://data.geo.admin.ch/browser/index.html#/collections/ch.swisstopo.swisseo_s2-sr_v100?.language=en) fetches latest version of the STAC catalog

## Configuration of products

### Configuration in <>_config.py  
Edit [configuration/dev_config.py](configuration/dev_config.py) rename it to your needs. 

#### Additional personal collections
A personal collection contains a GEE collection `my_new_collection` which contains postprocessed sensor data. The postprocessing is done according to the ` <new_file>.<new_function_name>` . E.g. The product `ch.swisstopo-swisseo_vhi_v100` is based on the `COPERNICUS/S2_SR_HARMONIZED` collection which has been postprocessed with `step0_processor_s2_sr.generate_s2_sr_mosaic_for_single_date` and stored in the personal collection 'projects/username/assets/COL_S2_SR_HARMONIZED_SWISS'

The personal collection needs to be created in advance in the GEE GUI via Assets -> new ->  Image collection

**Note:if you want to ensure that other accounts can update/read the asset ( like satromo-int) you need to give them access via right click on asset which will then open https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam?project=your-project and as well share "image collection" (like COL_S2_SR_HARMONIZED_SWISS).**

Adding a new collection in the tool require to adapt the configuration file. 

A new function specifically designed for this new collections should also be added in the step0_processors folder.
(If you don't need a new step0 processor function, you certainly don't need a new collection...)
Create the new function in a new file located in step0_processors folder.
In the configuration file, add the function to the configuration entry of your new collection:
The `cleaning_older_than` removes asset older teh defiend days to save GEE storage. 

```
step0: {
    ...
    my_new_collection: {
        step0_function: <new_file>.<new_function_name>,
        cleaning_older_than: <days> 
    }
}
```


#### Product definition based on personal collection
Products are defined  with the following mandatory parameters. more can be added, based on needs for the product generation.Do mind that for all products based on the same sensor the same personal collection should be used

```
my_new_product = {
    "prefix": <my_prefix>,
    "temporal_coverage": <number of days to take into account for product generation>,  
    "spatial_scale_export": <spatial resolution in m>,
    "product_name": <my_product_name>,
    "step0_collection": <my_new_collection to be used>
    ...
}

```
### Configuration post processing for each sensor step0_processor_<>.py
A new function specifically designed for each personal collections is stored in the [step0_processors](step0_processors) folder.
(If you don't need a new step0 processor function, you certainly don't need a new collection...)
Create the new function in a new file located in step0_processors folder.
